cenum is a parser for preprocessed C code which generates textual output for
each enum. Such output is sent to stdout by default, but the program may be
configured to write output for each enum to a separate file.

Output options:

-o directory - Write files to this directory. By default '-', which sends all
               output to stdout.
-x suffix    - Written files take this suffix. Requires '-o'. By default, '.c'.

Parser options:

-h header
-t footer
-e enumeration-text - Text to output for each enumeration.
-s annotation - Token which must preceed the 'enum' keyword in the C code.

Environment variables are also recognized:

cenum_directory
cenum_extension
cenum_header
cenum_footer
cenum_pattern
cenum_annotation

These variables may be referenced in the header, footer and enumeration text.

$n or $(name) - Identifier of the enum.

These variables may be referenced in the enumeration text.

$k or $(key)  - An enumeration.

cenum cannot parse enums without an identifier, so called 'anonymous' enums.

See cenum.c for further details.
